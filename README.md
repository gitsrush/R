1. Which variable(s) has the largest variability?
2. Create boxplots for each of the numeric variables. Are there any extreme values for any of the variables? Which ones?
3. Create a heatmap for the numeric variables. Discuss any interesting trend you see in this chart.
4. Interpretation of principal component analysis using unscaled numeric variables in the dataset.
5. Interpretation of principal component model after scaling the numeric variables.
